# I did it for

Here's my little django website to help track how long you've spent working toward a specific goal.

## About the code

I Did It forâ€¦ uses the Django python framework to create an useful application
for tracking the time you've spent working toward a project or goal or something
you are learning. I went with a bright bold design that represents an
interesting contrast to many of my other projects.

As usual, it has optional passkey authentication so you can log in instantly
with the biometrics already present on your device. In addition to full CRUD
functionality, it has Django's excellent administration backend for even
finer control of what is present in the database.

By using htmx, I was able to create an experience that has the responsiveness
of a single-page app, with the simplicity of a server-rendered application.

## Time-base motivation

Milestone based motivation can be effective, but can also be
discouraging when you miss your milestones. The reality is that
the most important factor in accomplishing something (especially
learning something), is consistently spending time on it.

By tracking the time spent on somthing rather than milestone accomplishments,
you will accomplish your goals in the same amount of time as you would have 
otherwise, but feel more motivated while doing it.
